 Robin Roche, 2011
 Establishes a TCP connection with a JADE agent in Java
 
 ** Requirements
 - Matlab (tested with version R2009b)
 - A software to edit and compile java files (Eclipse, etc.)
 - JADE packages imported into the project: see http://jade.tilab.com/ to get the jar files
 I assume you are more or less familiar with how Matlab and JADE work.
 
 ** Test instructions
 - Run java first, using the main function in LaunchJade.java.
 - Then run tcpTest.m
 This will establish a TCP connection between Matlab and Jade, which can then exhcnage data. 
 Both software can be in different location, just change the IP addresses and ports if needed.
 The code uses a sort of aknowledgment functionality, which checks if the message received is correct.
 Just change it to suit your needs.
 
 When running the test, you should see in the java console:
 Agent started
 Server connection initiated
 Message sent to Matlab: 0
 Message received from Matlab: 0
 Message sent to Matlab: 1
 Message received from Matlab: 1
 etc.

 And in Matlab:
 Connection established
 Message from JADE:
 0
 Message from JADE:
 1
 Message from JADE:
 2
 etc.
 
 ** Limitations
 - Matlab can only act as a TCP server, so it needs to be run second.
 - Matlab does also only support a single TCP connection established at a time (as of today anyway). 
 So you cannot have two running TCP connections with Matlab.
 - I have run some tests with intensive communication with Matlab. 
 It works but I don't think it should be used if you need a fast response or if you need many messages exchanged quickly.
 Sometimes, for some unknown reasons, the messages are badly conditioned...
